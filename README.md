# Replication exercise for Computational Economics

## Overview and Data Availability
This is the ReadMe for a replication of Clemens, Lews & Postel, "Immigration Restrictions as Active Labor Market Policy: Evidence from the Mexican Bracero Exclusion." (2018). The citation can be found below. 
The original code was in STATA, and can be found [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113187/version/V1/view) alongside the data used.

## Computational Requirements
- Julia (produced using version 1.11.2)
- The following packages: 
    - Test
    - HypothesisTests
    - Statistics
    - Plots
    - StatFiles
    - CSV
    - DataFrames
    - Dates
    - ReadStatTables
    - ReadStat
    - PanelDataTools
    - FixedEffectModels
    - GLM
    - RegressionTables
    - Distributions
    - PrettyTables
    - CategoricalArrays

## Scripts
The files are named after their respective purposes. *Data_cleaning.jl* cleans the raw data and exports the cleaned csv.'s to the output folder. *Table1.jl, Table2.jl, Table3.jl* all produce regression tables by the same number as in the paper. Similarly, *Figure2.jl, Figure3.jl* do the same for the graphs. *Functions.jl* is a script wherein intermediate functions are defined. These functions are used in several of the other scripts. Lastly, *CLP2018.jl* is the main file of interest - it defines the package.

## Instructions for replication
1. Go to your computer's terminal and open Julia's package manager.
2. Enter: `add "https://github.com/vivansharma2/CLP2018.jl"`
3. Return to the Julia REPL.
4. Enter: `using CLP2018`
5. Make sure that you are in the correct directory. If not, use `cd("path/to/your/data/CLP2018")` to get to the relevant envrionment. The code uses relative filepaths for this particular environment.
6. Enter: `CLP2018.run()`
7. This should run all of the code and produce all of the output.
